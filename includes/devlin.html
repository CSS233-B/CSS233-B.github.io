<div class="header" width="100%" align="center"><h2>HTML5 Multimedia Develop and Design</h2> <b>by Ian Devlin</b></div>

<p>One of the most exciting and talked about aspects of the HTML5 specification is the introduction of in-browser multimedia.  Websites no longer have to rely on a third-party tool such as Flash or Silverlight to play video and audio. This book is an easy, approachable guide to building native HTML5 multimedia into a website, from the simplest addition to more advanced features. It's written in a simple, straightforward style that's not too techy,  yet advanced enough for the more experienced coder who just needs to get up to speed on these powerful new capabilities. The book's companion website provides all the examples in a working format for easy access and enhanced visualization for the reader.</p>
