	<h1>Types of useful extensions:</h1>
		<p>Browser extensions are programs that can allow your browser to do more than what it can already do. For the purpose of making webpages, these extensions are quite useful:</p>

		<h2>Firebug</h2>
			<p>Firebug is a web development tool and an add-on for Firefox. The tool has a console for noting errors, and provides valuable debugging information for when your code goes horribly wrong. Click <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">here</a> for the add-on page, then search the tool. When Firebug is successfully installed, click its icon on the top right of the browser in order to start. Use this tool while developing your website to check for errors.</p>

		<h2>Chrome Developer Tools</h2>
			<p>While not an actual extension, Chrome Developer Tools works similarly to Firebug, but is used for Google Chrome. To implement the tools, use the shortcut by holding the following keys: Shift + CTRL, then press J.</p>
