	<h1>Control schemes:</h1>
		<p>When working on code with group members, it is best to divide the work so everyone can carry out their work efficiently. In other words, a good control scheme for management and efficiency would drastically clean up and expedite the coding process, allowing everyone to perform at their best.</p>

			<h2>Git</h2>
				<p>Git is a open source control system. With its branching system, people can work on different parts of their code while experimenting with ideas, with the ability to revert back to past code. Check out more information <a href ="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Github</h2>
				<p>Github is a hosting service for Git repositories - or rather, an area to store code. Check out more information <a href ="https://github.com/">here</a>. Once you've signed up for Github, create a repository and link your members (if any) to it.</p>
