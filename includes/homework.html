    <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
</div>

<p>Throughout the class we had a few homework assignments in which we
created a webpage from scratch to have the functionality and the
presentation elements of the Lola Pop menu. What you will see below are
a list of assignments that we created along with descriptions of each</p>

<ul>
    <li>Homework #1</li>
    <p>Our first assignment required us to build the "content" or Raw
    HTML file without any use for styling or functionality. the result
    is a very rudimentary looking page (and quite an ugly one)</p>
    <li>Homework #2</li>
    <p>For the second assignment we had to learn a little bit of CSS or
    Cascading Style Sheets in order to make our div tags move around and
    align them selves the way we wanted them to. This gives us a
    presentation based on our own design</p>
    <li>Homework #3</li>
    <p>Our first leap into Javascript has creating an arbituary function
    called "print.js" and then having us use that function to output
    something.</p>
    <li>Homework #4</li>
    <p>The last assignment we did was to simply take what we learned from
    Javascript and apply it to our webpage by make the end user able to 
    order items (without actually ordering them of course).</p>
</ul>
